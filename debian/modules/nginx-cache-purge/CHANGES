2011-12-20    VERSION 1.5
    * Fix on-disk cache size calculation.
      Since the initial release, recorded on-disk cache size was
      decreased twice for purged content (once during cache purge
      and once during subsequent cache update).
      This resulted in recorded on-disk cache size being much
      smaller than in reality, which could lead to on-disk cache
      outgrowing defined "max_size" parameter.
      Patch from Pyry Hakulinen.
