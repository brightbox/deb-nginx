'''ngx_chunkin''' - HTTP 1.1 chunked-encoding request body support for Nginx.

''This module is not distributed with the Nginx source.'' See [[#Installation|the installation instructions]].

= Status =

This module is considered production ready.

= Version =

This document describes ngx_chunkin [http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/tags v0.23rc2] released on November 24, 2011.

= Synopsis =

<geshi lang="nginx">
  chunkin on;
  
  error_page 411 = @my_411_error;
  location @my_411_error {
      chunkin_resume;
  }
  
  location /foo {
      # your fastcgi_pass/proxy_pass/set/if and
      # any other config directives go here...
  }
  ...
</geshi>

<geshi lang="nginx">
  chunkin on;
  
  error_page 411 = @my_411_error;
  location @my_411_error {
      chunkin_resume;
  }
  
  location /bar {
    chunkin_keepalive on;  # WARNING: too experimental!
    
    # your fastcgi_pass/proxy_pass/set/if and
    # any other config directives go here...
  }
</geshi>

= Description =

This module adds [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.6.1 HTTP 1.1 chunked] input support for Nginx without the need of patching the Nginx core.

Behind the scene, it registers an access-phase handler that will eagerly read and decode incoming request bodies when a <code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code> header triggers a <code>411</code> error page in Nginx. For requests that are not in the <code>chunked</code> transfer encoding, this module is a "no-op".

To enable the magic, just turn on the [[#chunkin|chunkin]] config option and define a custom <code>411 error_page</code> using [[#chunkin_resume|chunkin_resume]], like this:

<geshi lang="nginx">
  server {
    chunkin on;

    error_page 411 = @my_411_error;
    location @my_411_error {
        chunkin_resume;
    }

    ...
  }
</geshi>

No other modification is required in your nginx.conf file and everything should work out of the box including the standard [[HttpProxyModule|proxy module]] (except for those [[#Known Issues|known issues]]). Note that the [[#chunkin|chunkin]] directive is not allowed in the location block while the [[#chunkin_resume|chunkin_resume]] directive is only allowed on in <code>locations</code>.

The core module's [[HttpCoreModule#client_body_buffer_size|client_body_buffer_size]], [[HttpCoreModule#client_max_body_size|client_max_body_size]], and [[HttpCoreModule#client_body_timeout|client_body_timeout]] directive settings are honored. Note that, the "body sizes" here always indicate chunked-encoded body, not the data that has already been decoded. Basically, the
chunked-encoded body will always be slightly larger than the original data that is not encoded.

The [[HttpCoreModule#client_body_in_file_only|client_body_in_file_only]] and [[HttpCoreModule#client_body_in_single_buffer|client_body_in_single_buffer]] settings are followed partially. See [[#Known Issues|Know Issues]].

This module is not supposed to be merged into the Nginx core because I've used [http://www.complang.org/ragel/ Ragel] to generate the chunked encoding parser for joy :)

== How it works ==

Nginx explicitly checks chunked <code>Transfer-Encoding</code> headers and absent content length header in its very
early phase. Well, as early as the <code>ngx_http_process_request_header</code>
function. So this module takes a rather tricky approach. That is, use an output filter to intercept the <code>411 Length Required</code> error page response issued by <code>ngx_http_process_request_header</code>,
fix things and finally issue an internal redirect to the current location,
thus starting from those phases we all know and love, this time
bypassing the horrible <code>ngx_http_process_request_header</code> function.

In the <code>rewrite</code> phase of the newly created request, this module eagerly reads in the chunked request body in a way similar to that of the standard <code>ngx_http_read_client_request_body</code> function, but using its own chunked parser generated by Ragel. The decoded request body will be put into <code>r->request_body->bufs</code> and a corresponding <code>Content-Length</code> header will be inserted into <code>r->headers_in</code>.

Those modules using the standard <code>ngx_http_read_client_request_body</code> function to read the request body will just work out of box because <code>ngx_http_read_client_request_body</code> returns immediately when it sees <code>r->request_body->bufs</code> already exists.

Special efforts have been made to reduce data copying and dynamic memory allocation.

= Directives =

== chunkin ==
'''syntax:''' ''chunkin on|off''

'''default:''' ''off''

'''context:''' ''http, server''

'''phase:''' ''access''

Enables or disables this module's hooks.

== chunkin_resume ==
'''syntax:''' ''chunkin_resume''

'''default:''' ''no''

'''context:''' ''location''

'''phase:''' ''content''

This directive must be used in your custom <code>411 error page</code> location to help this module work correctly. For example:

<geshi lang="nginx">
  error_page 411 = @my_error;
  location @my_error {
      chunkin_resume;
  }
</geshi>

For the technical reason behind the necessity of this directive, please read the <code>nginx-devel</code> thread [http://nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2009-December/000041.html Content-Length is not ignored for chunked requests: Nginx violates RFC 2616].

This directive was first introduced in the [[#v0.17|v0.17]] release.

== chunkin_max_chunks_per_buf ==
'''syntax:''' ''chunkin_max_chunks_per_buf <number>''

'''default:''' ''512''

'''context:''' ''http, server, location''

Set the max chunk count threshold for the buffer determined by the [[HttpCoreModule#client_body_buffer_size|client_body_buffer_size]] directive.
If the average chunk size is <code>1 KB</code> and your [[HttpCoreModule#client_body_buffer_size|client_body_buffer_size]] setting
is 1 meta bytes, then you should set this threshold to <code>1024</code> or <code>2048</code>.

When the raw body size is exceeding [[HttpCoreModule#client_body_buffer_size|client_body_buffer_size]] ''or'' the chunk counter is exceeding this <code>chunkin_max_chunks_per_buf</code> setting, the decoded data will be temporarily buffered into disk files, and then the main buffer gets cleared and the chunk counter gets reset back to 0 (or <code>1</code> if there's a "pending chunk").

This directive was first introduced in the [[#v0.17|v0.17]] release.

== chunkin_keepalive ==
'''syntax:''' ''chunkin_keepalive on|off''

'''default:''' ''off''

'''context:''' ''http, server, location, if''

Turns on or turns off HTTP 1.1 keep-alive and HTTP 1.1 pipelining support.

Keep-alive without pipelining should be quite stable but pipelining support is very preliminary, limited, and almost untested.

This directive was first introduced in the [[#v0.07|v0.07 release]].

'''Technical note on the HTTP 1.1 pipeling support'''

The basic idea is to copy the bytes left by my chunked parser in
<code>r->request_body->buf</code> over into <code>r->header_in</code> so that nginx's
<code>ngx_http_set_keepalive</code> and <code>ngx_http_init_request</code> functions will pick
it up for the subsequent pipelined requests. When the request body is
small enough to be completely preread into the <code>r->header_in</code> buffer,
then no data copy is needed here -- just setting <code>r->header_in->pos</code>
correctly will suffice.

The only issue that remains is how to enlarge <code>r->header_in</code> when the
data left in <code>r->request_body->buf</code> is just too large to be hold in the
remaining room between <code>r->header_in->pos</code> and <code>r->header_in->end</code>. For
now, this module will just give up and simply turn off <code>r->keepalive</code>.

I know we can always use exactly the remaining room in <code>r->header_in</code> as
the buffer size when reading data from <code>c->recv</code>, but's suboptimal when
the remaining room in <code>r->header_in</code> happens to be very small while
<code>r->request_body->buf</code> is quite large.

I haven't fully grokked all the details among <code>r->header_in</code>, <code>c->buffer</code>,
busy/free lists and those so-called "large header buffers". Is there a
clean and safe way to reallocate or extend the <code>r->header_in</code> buffer?

= Installation =

Grab the nginx source code from [http://nginx.org/ nginx.org], for example,
the version 1.0.8 (see [[#Compatibility|nginx compatibility]]), and then build the source with this module:

<geshi lang="bash">
    wget 'http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.0.8.tar.gz'
    tar -xzvf nginx-1.0.8.tar.gz
    cd nginx-1.0.8/
    
    # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
        --add-module=/path/to/chunkin-nginx-module
     
    make -j2
    make install
</geshi>

Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from [http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/tags chunkin-nginx-module file list].

== For Developers ==

The chunked parser is generated by [http://www.complang.org/ragel/ Ragel]. If you want to
regenerate the parser's C file, i.e., [http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/blob/master/src/chunked_parser.c src/chunked_parser.c], use
the following command from the root of the chunkin module's source tree:

<geshi lang="bash">
    $ ragel -G2 src/chunked_parser.rl
</geshi>

= Packages from users =

== Fedora 13 RPM files ==

The following source and binary rpm files are contributed by Ernest Folch, with nginx 0.8.54, ngx_chunkin v0.21 and ngx_headers_more v0.13:

* [http://agentzh.org/misc/nginx/ernest/nginx-0.8.54-1.fc13.src.rpm nginx-0.8.54-1.fc13.src.rpm]
* [http://agentzh.org/misc/nginx/ernest/nginx-0.8.54-1.fc13.x86_64.rpm nginx-0.8.54-1.fc13.x86_64.rpm]

= Compatibility =

The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

* '''1.1.x'''                       (last tested: 1.1.5)
* '''1.0.x'''                       (last tested: 1.0.10)
* '''0.8.x'''                       (last tested: 0.8.54)
* '''0.7.x >= 0.7.21'''             (last tested: 0.7.67)

Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will ''not'' work.

If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.21 does not work with this module, please consider [[#Report Bugs|reporting a bug]].

= ChangeLog =

== v0.22 ==
* now we remove the request header Transfer-Encoding completely because at least Apache will complain about the empty-value <code>Transfer-Encoding</code> request header. thanks hoodoos and Sandesh Kotwal.
* now we allow DELETE requests with chunked request bodies per hoodoos's request.
* now we use the 2-clause BSD license.

== v0.21 ==
* applied a patch from Gong Kaihui (龚开晖) to always call <code>post_handler</code> in <code>ngx_http_chunkin_read_chunked_request_body</code>.

== v0.20 ==
* fixed a bug that may read incomplete chunked body. thanks Gong Kaihui (龚开晖).
* fixed various memory issues in the implementation which may cause nginx processes to crash.
* added support for chunked PUT requests.
* now we always require "error_page 411 @resume" and no default (buggy) magic any more. thanks Gong Kaihui (龚开晖).

== v0.19 ==
* we now use ragel -G2 to generate the chunked parser and we're 36% faster.
* we now eagerly read the data octets in the chunked parser and we're 43% faster.

== v0.18 ==
* added support for <code>chunk-extension</code> to the chunked parser as per [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.6.1 RFC 2616], but we just ignore them (if any) because we don't understand them.
* added more diagnostic information for certian error messages.

== v0.17 ==
* implemented the [[#chunkin_max_chunks_per_buf|chunkin_max_chunks_per_buf]] directive to allow overriding the default <code>512</code> setting.
* we now bypass nginx's [http://nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2009-December/000041.html discard requesty body bug] by requiring our users to define explicit <code>411 error_page</code> with [[#chunkin_resume|chunkin_resume]] in the error page location. Thanks J for reporting related bugs.
* fixed <code>r->phase_handler</code> in our post read handler. our handler may run one more time before :P
* the chunkin handler now returns <code>NGX_DECLINED</code> rather than <code>NGX_OK</code> when our <code>ngx_http_chunkin_read_chunked_request_body</code> function returns <code>NGX_OK</code>, to avoid bypassing other access-phase handlers.

== v0.16 ==
* turned off ddebug in the previous release. thanks J for reporting it.

== v0.15 ==
* fixed a regression that ctx->chunks_count never incremented in earlier versions.

== v0.14 ==
* now we no longer skip those operations between the (interrupted) ngx_http_process_request_header and the server rewrite phase. this fixed the security issues regarding the [[HttpCoreModule#internal|internal]] directive as well as SSL sessions.
* try to ignore CR/LF/SP/HT at the begining of the chunked body.
* now we allow HT as padding spaces and ignore leading CRLFs.
* improved diagnostic info in the error.log messages when parsefail occurs.

== v0.11 ==
* added a random valid-chunked-request generator in t/random.t.
* fixed a new connection leak issue caught by t/random.t.

== v0.10 ==
* fixed a serious bug in the chunked parser grammer: there would be ambiguity when CRLF appears in the chunked data sections. Thanks J for reporting it.

== v0.08 ==
* fixed gcc compilation errors on x86_64, thanks J for reporting it.
* used the latest Ragel 6.6 to generate the <code>chunked_parser.c</code> file in the source tree.

== v0.07 ==

* marked the disgarded 411 error page's output chain bufs as consumed by setting <code>buf->pos = buf->last</code>. (See [http://nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2009-December/000025.html this nginx-devel thread] for more details.)
* added the [[#chunkin_keepalive|chunkin_keepalive]] directive which can enable HTTP 1.1 keep-alive and HTTP 1.1 pipelining, and defaults to <code>off</code>.
* fixed the <code>alphtype</code> bug in the Ragel parser spec; which caused rejection of non-ascii octets in the chunked data. Thanks J for his bug report.
* added <code>Test::Nginx::Socket</code> to test our nginx module on the socket level. Thanks J for his bug report.
* rewrote the bufs recycling part and preread-buf-to-rb-buf transition part, also refactored the Ragel parser spec, thus eliminating lots of serious bugs.
* provided better diagnostics in the error log message for "bad chunked body" parsefails in the chunked parser. For example:

<geshi lang="text">
 2009/12/02 17:35:52 [error] 32244#0: *1 bad chunked body (offset 7, near "4^M
 hell <-- HERE o^M
 0^M
 ^M
 ", marked by " <-- HERE ").
 , client: 127.0.0.1, server: localhost, request: "POST /main
HTTP/1.1", host: "localhost"
</geshi>

* added some code to let the chunked parser handle special 0-size chunks that are not the last chunk.
* fixed a connection leak bug regarding incorrect <code>r->main->count</code> reference counter handling for nginx 0.8.11+ (well, the <code>ngx_http_read_client_request_body</code> function in the nginx core also has this issue, I'll report it later.)

== v0.06 ==
* minor optimization: we won't traverse the output chain link if the chain count is not large enough.

= Test Suite =

This module comes with a Perl-driven test suite. The [http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/tree/master/test/t/ test cases] are
[http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/blob/master/test/t/sanity.t declarative] too. Thanks to the [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Base Test::Base] module in the Perl world.

To run it on your side:

<geshi lang="bash">
    $ cd test
    $ PATH=/path/to/your/nginx-with-chunkin-module:$PATH prove -r t
</geshi>

You need to terminate any Nginx processes before running the test suite if you have changed the Nginx server binary.

At the moment, [http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?LWP::UserAgent LWP::UserAgent] is used by the [http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/blob/master/test/lib/Test/Nginx/LWP.pm test scaffold] for simplicity.

Because a single nginx server (by default, <code>localhost:1984</code>) is used across all the test scripts (<code>.t</code> files), it's meaningless to run the test suite in parallel by specifying <code>-jN</code> when invoking the <code>prove</code> utility.

Some parts of the test suite requires modules [[HttpProxyModule|proxy]] and [[HttpEchoModule|echo]] to be enabled as well when building Nginx.

= Known Issues =

* May not work with certain 3rd party modules like the [http://www.grid.net.ru/nginx/upload.en.html upload module] because it implements its own request body reading mechanism.
* "client_body_in_single_buffer on" may *not* be obeyed for short contents and fast network.
* "client_body_in_file_only on" may *not* be obeyed for short contents and fast network.
* HTTP 1.1 pipelining may not fully work yet.

= TODO =

* make the chunkin handler run at the end of the <code>access phase</code> rather than beginning.
* add support for <code>trailers</code> as specified in the [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.6.1 RFC 2616].
* fix the [[#Known Issues|known issues]].
